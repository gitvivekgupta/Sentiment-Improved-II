Run the following

1. features.py


There are 4 different models in the repository.

-- one_feat (with 1 feature space)
-- three_feat (with 3 feature space)
-- four_feat (with 4 feature space)
-- seven_feat (with 7 feature space)


Each of these model has a slight variant inside them, so you can say these are total 8 models (variants) of KNN.

    -- 1fmodel_diff.py
    -- 1fmodel_same.py

    -- 3fmodel_diff.py
    -- 3fmodel_same.py

--- four_feat
    -- 4fmodel_diff.py
    -- 4fmodel_same.py

--- seven_feat
    -- 7fmodel_diff.py
    -- 7fmodel_same.py


2. Select a Model and go into the directory


3. run - xfmodel_diff.py and xfmodel_same.py


4. In the same folder after completion run accuracy.py (comment out the required file)


5. Done! You can see the final results now.
